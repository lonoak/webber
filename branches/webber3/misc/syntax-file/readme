This is a HTML adapted syntax file for vim ,  to use:

1. Copy wbb.vim to your .vim directory

2. add in your .vimrc 

au BufRead,BufNewFile *.wbb set filetype=wbb
au BufRead,BufNewFile wbbdir.cfg set filetype=wbb
au! Syntax wbb source PATH_TO_YOUR_HOME/.vim/wbb.vim 

That's all

 The only modification is that ## lines are treat as comments,
and "#var=" entries as tokens
