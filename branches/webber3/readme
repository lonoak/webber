Redme for webber.


 This is a fresh port webber system, without any reference to the RedIRIS's implementation of it.

Webber is mainly a HTML formatter, that has been used since 1995 at RedIRIS to build the HTML pages. It was designed mainly to:

* Provide a uniform looking of all the HTML pages
* Perform some linking (mostly language and menu pages) automatically

So webber can be seen like a pre-Y2K CMS (Content Management System), that can be used to build static web pages with the 
same look and feel without so much efford, it's mostly useful when you want to change this look and feel of the web pages
without needing to rewrite all the web pages.

 The basic installation of webber would have the following structure:
 
binary webber, would be installed at PREFIX/bin
libraries (Procs, in webber terminology), would go to $PREFIX/lib/webber/proc
Documenation (html pages) , would be generated at $PREFIX/share/doc/webber

Example templares would be found at $PREFIX/lib/webber/webs , with all the information,

A configuaration example webber.cfg would be at $PREFIX/etc
